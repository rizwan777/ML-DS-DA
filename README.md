# <center> Python for  ML / Data Science</center>
## According to your goal you can follow the instruction to achieve your goal easily and effectivily.
###------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------###
# Goal -{MachineLearning}
{ To achieve good result first need to learn required libraries and its working architecture to get Optimal results. }
All the Required Libraries Core Implementation with the Core concepts with Details

### >>> for noobies to python journey start with 
#### 1. Installation the python3 (you can select as per your wish)
#### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook (or anyother as per your wish, jupyter is best to understand the code and output.)
#### 3. Install required Dependencies 
#### 4. follow up the series Start with 01,02,03 files from the given source.
#### 5. you are ready to go ....!!
##### (note: afer compliting {Python Crash Corse seriese (01,02,03)} from this Tutorial Series then try to solve the excercises by yourself.)

### Libraies Are Implemented And Updated Regularly Basis { hope so }
 1. Pandas
 2. Tensorflow
 3. Numpy 

### In all Above Mantion Libraries i have coded for core concepts to become more familiar download zip file and use it.
In Each and Every code files i have written all the useful core concepts and its notes will be mantion line by line to learn/implement easily.
you just simple download the zip file and its dependences simple, you ready to go ..!!
and then after one by one uncomment the code and take a look to its output..!!

# Goal -{Data Science}
==> In this Tutorial Series  i will trying to help you through out the journey to Data Science. 

==> This Tutorial Series only for helping purpose who seriously want to do something. there was no issues to share or to modify the content. you are independent to make more effective, add some upgraded stuff, and share with others.

==> it really doesn't matter what profession you are belonging, time is always right just thing is that we need to accept/reject it.

## >>> or, you think if you comfortable with the python basics then you can directly follow up from the journey at first point to the end.
### 1. Numpy (all operations realted to array which are useful to us was covered)
    .... updated soon...    
    

### ==> Content will be updated soon..!! i hope i get time and update it sooner as possible..!!
